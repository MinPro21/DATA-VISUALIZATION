# DATA-VISUALIZER
The proverb "a picture is worth a thousand words" describes the 
goal of data visualizer appropriately. Data visualizer seeks to present information in a concise, yet comprehensible form. 
Visualizations can emphasize important points and provide the 
user with useful things, such as summaries of data. Data Visualizer helps you to convert your data from numerical form to pictorial form, all you need to do is select the type of pictorial representation you desire and input values in the provided table/input box. And then the pictorial representation will be displayed on your screen. We will be using Java, html and css languages to develop Data Visualizer.
